## The Caesar cipher

A cipher is a type of secret code, where you swap the letters around so that no-one can read your message.

You'll be using one of the oldest and most famous ciphers, the **Caesar cipher**, which is named after Julius Caesar.

Before we start coding, let's try using the Caesar cipher to hide a word.

+ Hiding a word is called **encryption**.
    
    Let's start by encrypting the letter 'a'. To do this, we can draw the alphabet in a circle, like this:

+ To make a secret encrypted letter from a normal one, you need to have a secret key. Let's use the number 3 as the key (but you can use any number you like).
    
    To **encrypt** the letter 'a', you just move 3 letters clockwise, which will give you the letter 'd':

+ You can use what you've learnt to encrypt an entire word. For example, 'hello' encrypted is 'khoor'. Try it yourself.
    
    + h + 3 = **k**
    + e + 3 = **h**
    + l + 3 = **o**
    + l + 3 = **o**
    + o + 3 = **r**

+ Getting text back to normal is called **decryption**. To decrypt a word, just subtract the key instead of adding it:
    
    + k - 3 = **h**
    + h - 3 = **e**
    + o - 3 = **l**
    + o - 3 = **l**
    + r - 3 = **o**
