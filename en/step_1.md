## Introduction:

In this project, you'll learn how to make your own encryption program, to send and receive secret messages with a friend. This project ties in with the "Earth to Principia" activity on page 16 of the Space Diary.

## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make an encryption program, to send and receive secret messages with a friend. This project introduces iteration (looping) over a text string.

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred.

You can find the completed project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ messages-finished/messages.py
+ messages-finished/friends.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
+ Iteration (looping) over a string variable;
+ The `find()` method;
+ The modulus operator (`%`).

## Challenges
+ Use a Caesar cipher - encrypt and decrypt letters and words manually;
+ Variable keys - allowing the user to input a chosen key;
+ Encrypting and decrypting messages - encrypting and decrypting whole messages;
+ Friendship calculator - applying text iteration to a new problem.

## Frequently Asked Questions
+ When searching using `find()` or `if char in alphabet:`, note that searches are case-sensitive. Children can use:

	```python
	message = input("Please enter a message to encrypt: ").lower()
	```

	to make the input lower case before searching.
